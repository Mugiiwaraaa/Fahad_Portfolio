      <description>Understanding The Business Problem Loan Applications can be daunting for both the clients and the bank organisation. A lot of resources such as time and finances , the risk of trusting a client to pay back the loans is considered for every application. Manual processing is just not efficient with hundreds of thousands of applications and can be biased a lot of the times.
The Data Science Solution Using Machine Learning to automate the loan eligibility process in real time where the major eligibility criteria focuses on the assurance of getting the money back from the clients.</description>

      <description>Designed a model that predicts the chances of a patient having Breast Cancer. This is a small step towards how we can detect early symptoms of Breast Cancer which gives us a better chance of prevention.
Dataset - This particular dataset can be imported from the sklearn.datasets library or you can download it from the kaggle resource provided in the Github repository linked below.
Model - The major aim in this project is to predict the type of tumor(Malignant or Benign) based on the features using some of the deep learning techniques and algorithms.</description>

      <description>Problem Statement You want to understand the customer&amp;rsquo;s spending behaviour and group them so that, more critical insights can be given to the marketing team which will help them plan strategies accordingly.
I approached this problem statement by designing a model that uses certain customer data to group them accordingly.
Dataset - Fetched the data from the Kaggle resource which I have linked in my Github Repository. The Dataset includes various features/information about the customers.</description>

      <description>Designed a model that predicts the chances of winning a football ⚽ match for your favourite premiere league team.
Dataset - Scraped and fetched data from the resources provided in the GitHub Repository. The Dataset contains some important statistics for the last 12 seasons of the English Premier League.
Model - The major aim in this project is to build a predictor that predicts the chances of winning a game based on the previous statistical data by using classification algorithms and techniques such as the Naive Bayes Classifier , RandomForest and Decision Tree Classifier , Logistic Regression Classifier and Support Vector Machine Classifier.</description>
